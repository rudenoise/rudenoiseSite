# About this Web-Log

I've done blogs before. One was about programming and included
posts about things like
[technical debt in code](https://medium.com/@rudenoise/code-life-cycle-every-line-is-technical-debt-f90db48786d8).
Another was about a man who travels through time to hear
[toilet related stories](http://poochat.blogspot.co.uk/) from well-known faces.

Then I stopped. For the last few years I've been filling
up notebooks, chatting on to people I know and making
things out of code. This has been fine but it hasn't
really lead anywhere.

Now I want to create the possibility that the stuff I
think about might overlap with the stuff other people
think about. Then those people have a small chance of
discovering this overlap and then they might respond.
In which case I might learn something, make a friend
or even be called a twat. Which doesn't happen often
enough.

So this will be a web-log of my thoughts, a
broad remit.
