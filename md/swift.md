# Swift Diary: Part 1

## What am I doing?

I had an idea for a side-project: a writing tool using data-structures
from Graph Theory.

I decided to write it in Swift (v3), which now works on Linux decoupled from
the Apple ecosystem.

## Why Swift?

I like the simplicity and ease of use that the Go/Golang tools provide
(repl, fast and simple compiler, simple package management, simple test
tool etc...).

I like the functional style, strong type-system and language features
like pattern-matching that OCaml provides.

Swift has these attributes in one language. While not quite a strong on
the types and OCaml or idiomatic as Go, it is strong enough for my needs.
Like a low maintenance OCaml that boring companies might actually use.
