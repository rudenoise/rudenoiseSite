# Using Phones

I've been resistant to embracing the smart phone as part of my
life. Not that one hasn't been in heavy use since the Nokia E61.

By using it disdainfully, I haven't been open to the opportunity
for incorporating steez into the activity. What apps do I use,
how do I use them, what feelings do their UXs cause, how can I
harness the properties of the media within..?

I like Mike Skinner and his approach to style, media and use of
imagery. Looking at the photo stream associated with Tonga Balloon
Gang I realised that the usage of phones is prominent:

They're taps into phone culture more than I think I've seen
anyone else dong. Even the phone companies put the phone in
the background. We're ashamed of our phone usage, but kids
aren't. Tonga Balloon Gang aren't.
