# February 2017 Update

Last year I gorged on code, as a result the pendulum of my
attention has swung to other interests. I still write plenty of
code for work but it feels like a fallow period might be useful.
Also putting more attention into other areas is likely to provide
ideas for future code projects.

The weather has been incompatible with street skating, lately. The
bulk of my meagre free time has been spent making music. I've also
managed a few concept drawings to support some projects I've been
thinking about.

The aim is still to create a complete artifact, incorporating
audio, web and drawing.

On the event side I'm planning to run _Battery Beats_: an event for
collaborative digital music production.

As far as creating over consuming goes: it's hard. Too much time
has been spent assessing gear, however the creative efforts are
building up. The ratio should shift heavily towards creation
shortly.

## Work in Progress:

1. this blog;
2. Battery Beats;
3. publishing small pieces of audio;
4. collecting material for a complete audio/zine publication.
