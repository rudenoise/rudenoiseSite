# Writing System 2016

Here comes some ramble, [the meat](#theMeat) comes after.

I like writing stuff.

The equipment that I use should be inspiring, making it part of the
 process. 

The first digital: I use a Mac Book Pro.
I attach a decent external keyboard (a WASD) and a big monitor.
I think the ultimate in laptop typing is probably the
ThinkPad X220 but I can't really justify having two laptops.
Typing on computers is secondary to handwriting but essential to
publishing, I can definitely recommend learning to touch-type.
Vim as a text-editor, can't recommend it highly enough.

Again this is as much about feel as creativity. If it feels good it is good. It's an aesthetic choice.

The second, analogue:
I use a Pilot Capless and a Kaweko Lilliput (formy pocket, both nibs polished with micro-mesh pads).
Rhodia dot notepads. These have to be easy tear out (perforated).

## <a id='theMeat'></a>The Problem

I fill up notebooks with thoughts. They go on a shelf and once a
year come back down to be read and then I am bored because
they are repetitive fragments that don't really go anywhere.

There needs to be some editorial process and refinement.

## The Solution

Reading about other writers' processes lead me to pick a few ideas
that I think would work for me. These are the inspiration:

> [â€¦ when a] draft is finished, I put the manuscript away for a while, a week,
> a month, sometimes longer. When I take it out again, I read it as
> coldly as possible, then read it aloud to a friend or two, and
> decide what changes I want to make and whether or not I want to
> publish it.

> The pattern of the thing precedes the thing. I fill in the gaps
> of the crossword at any spot I happen to choose. These bits I
> write on index cards until the novel is done. My schedule is
> flexible, but I am rather particular about my instruments: lined
> Bristol cards and well sharpened, not too hard, pencils capped
> with erasers.

In his book How Shall I Tell the Dog, Miles Kington references
box-files in which he'd placed various notes and beginnings under
various subject headings. He also mentions that whenever he dipped
in and saw a promising section heading it would turn out to be empty.

And so I mixed all that together and now have this:
