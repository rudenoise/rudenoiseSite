# 2016 Reviewed

All sorts of crap happened this year and I expect it'll be well
reviewed elsewhere. I'm particularly looking forward to Charlie
Brooker's 2016 Wipe. This is a more self-centred/personal review.

## Wot I Done:

* Some OCaml/MirageOS/Marrakech Hackathon
* Grift (the beginnings of a Graph DB in Swift)
* Minimal Computing (contributing to the conversation)
* Minimal Audio (small programs for noises)
* Explored some of OpenBSD
* Drew a couple of pictures
* Wrote this Blog
* Started meditating
* Loads of contracting
* Parenting and husbandry

## Writing and Notes

I started this blog back in January and I have managed to maintain
it, posting an average of just over once a month. A small
achievement. Previous attempts have fallen by the wayside sooner or
been much more sporadic.

My first post described a writing system that I intended to follow
for the rest of the year. I followed it for one week.

However, it did form the basis for a new note keeping system that
has lasted. I now use Rhodia Dot pads that tear out easily. I can
then fill pages of notes which I later file into envelopes labeled
for various topics/projects. It isn't perfect - my ideas feel like
networks/graphs not hierarchies and I'm yet to find a tool/system
that accurately reflects this.

I started a couple of small projects. First was contributing to the
Minimal Computing Working Group. Discovering that others are
thinking about and discussing this topic inspired me to contribute
and clarify some of my opinions and get them down in writing. I
intend to continue this next year.

The other was to start drawing again. I've never been particularly
good at (or dedicated to) drawing and lost much of my enthusiasm for
it during a failed art A-Level. Still, new set of Copic pens and paper
resulted in a small highlight: the seal of approval from
Neighbour's Dr Karl Kennedy himself, Alan Fletcher.

## Equipment

I ditched OSX and the Macbook Pro and returned to Linux and
ThinkPad. Discovering the i3 Window Manager made the largest impact
on my work-flow. If you prefer a text-centric UI then I can highly
recommend i3.

I resurrected my ThinkPad X61s and installed OpenBSD. I'm only
scratching the surface but so far it seems like an OS I might
actually be able to understand.

## Computing

My public programming has also been pretty consistent, I've mucked
about with 20 repositories on GitHub this year. Played with some
new tools: x86 assembly, C, OCaml, Swift and OpenBSD being the
highlights.

I've written more OCaml than any other language and can recommend
its environment, capabilities and community. My week in Marrakech
at the MirageOS Hackathon was the best computing related event I've
been involved with. I really enjoyed the informality and
conversational approach, if you've found conferences and seminars
haven't grabbed you then I recommend finding events in this vein.

I also started exploring Graph Theory and its applications, I
managed to start a small project in Swift 3 building and in-memory
Graph Engine that can persist as JSON. It felt like the start of
something, exactly what I don't know.

## Conclusions

I've been quite depressed this year, mostly relating to a
frustration with a lack of "progress". Progress with what? Finding
a project that I can commit to and then work on consistently.

Writing this I realise that I have managed to do quite a lot of
exploration and experimentation. I had thought that I don't really
have enough time to get anything significant done (outside regular
work and family life). Adding it all up: that doesn't appear to be
the case.

I wasn't depressed the whole time, only when thinking about my
personal projects. My wife and daughters continue to be be the
funniest and most enjoyable company I can imagine. I'm lucky and I
know it.

Doing a bit of mindful meditation has also helped a little. I might
become religious next year.

The work I have done has hopped subjects and media. If all of that
effort could be applied to one project, and I could discover the
right motivation, then next year might be a little different.

Did this blog achieve its aim of connecting me to others? I was
going to say _no_ but, on reflection, I have managed to use it as a
stepping stone.
Joining in with the MirageOS group was really interesting and the
Minimal Computing Group is promising. I'm not working in complete
social isolation.

Has my move to contracting allowed me to work in a way that better
suites me? Yes, it's taken a while (coming up on 3 years) but I
have been able to make a lot of time for writing and R&D.

Final thought: this year looks much better written down, there is a
fair bit to show for the effort.
