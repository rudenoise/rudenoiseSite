# Low Tech Minimal Computing

_Adapted from a version of this text posted to

Low Tech Magazine recently posted two essays that address
topics relevant to _Minimal Computing_:

The first centres around the changes in office working practices and
the transition to computerised work environments. It describes how
the idea of a "paperless office" hasn't lead to lower energy
consumption and also suggests older, mechanical approaches
could dovetail with computing to good effect. <sub>[_[1](#ref1)_]</sub>

The second covers similar ground with a focus on the office itself
and how remote working increases the energy consumption of each
worker. <sub>[_[2](#ref2)_]</sub>

These cross over with a recent New Yorker article about the analog
work spaces of modern tech companies (I can vouch for both the
motivations and benefits as I work in offices designed to these
specifications). <sub>[_[3](#ref3)_]</sub>

It's interesting to recognise that a lot of my best "computational
thinking" happens away from the computer (often in my notebooks or
in conversation). I suppose that the most minimal computation is
that done in one's head?

All computer programs require energy to run so the most efficient
programs are those that run fastest and are not run very often, if
at all!
