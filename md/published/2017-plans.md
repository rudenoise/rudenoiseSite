# 2017 Plans

This year I plan to:

* keep skating;
* keep writing;
* keep drawing;
* code creatively;
* make some music.

Using the following tools:

* ThinkPad x250 + Ubuntu + i3wm;
* Pilot Capless and Copic Pens;
* Korg Electribe Sampler 2;
* iPhone SE;
* 8" 5050 and Skateboard Cafe boards;
* Airmax BWs.

Embody these principles and values:

* play and laugh;
* create over consume;
* trivia over grand meaning;
* observe and reflect.

Work towards these projects:

* zine (paper/ePub);
* audio (bass-music/audio-zine/podcast);
* daily/weekly chain-exercises: write, draw, audio, skate,
  code;
* meditate.

To Do:

* attend a conference/event;
* publish _finished/complete/finite_ things;
* make friends, chat, laugh, be cool.
