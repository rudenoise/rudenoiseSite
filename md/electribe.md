# Thoughts on my Korg Electribe Sampler 2

It's a computer with a User Interface that focusses on tactile
input and auditory output.

It feels like the digital-audio equivalent to a pencil and post-it
notes. As a result I'm very creative with it. The level of
abstraction is perfect for my constrained time. Its low power
consumption makes it extremely portable (smaller than a laptop and
runs on 6 AA batteries).

It is very constrained (memory, reconfigurability/programmability)
and has chosen a high degree of abstraction from the processes that
underpin its performance. However it has chosen these abstractions
well, I can perform just enough of any class of interactions that I
can signal my intent and experiment with it.

I gave up making dance music in my 20s after becoming frustrated
with lack of progress. I was getting bogged down in the details of
sound engineering. Also the interfaces I was using were presented
through my PC screen and manipulated via keyboard, mouse and a midi
keyboard. I was caught in that particular medium. I never had the
time to cover the ground I'd chosen.

Now I have less time. With this tool I'm getting the work-payoff
cycle in shorter iterations and illustrating my ideas more fully.
The illustration may be a pencil sketch but that can be enough; the
pencil sketch can also be worked up into a fuller medium once the
idea is proven.
