# Skateboarding

I skate and have done, on and off, since I was 8. It's a part of my
identity. Values that originate in skateboarding are amongst those
that I feel most powerfully:

* Style over everything else;
* Play;
* Work with what you have;
* Community;
* No authority;
* Art over competition;
* ...

I have mixed feelings about skateboarding being "accepted" into the
Olympics for 2020.

It's a chance to improve the business of skateboarding and keep
funding skaters. I'm pleased for those skaters who enjoy the
competitive aspects of the activity.

This is a good thing for skateboarding the "sport" but to many
skaters sport is not a category they recognise for their activity.
I identify with those who feel "art" to be a better category:

* Pointless;
* Style based;
* Community validated;
* Organic;

Skaters I've admired are to me as musicians are to most fans.

Tom Penny's skating makes me happy. He won competitions but
his participation disrupted them, he didn't appear to be trying.
He wasn't competing, competition footage suggests he's accidentally
winning. Like the park was in his meandering path to the shop.
