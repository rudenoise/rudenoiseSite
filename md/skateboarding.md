# Skateboarding

I skate and have done, on and off, since I was 8. It's a part of my
identity. Values that originate in skateboarding are amongst those
that I feel most powerfully:

* Style over everything else;
* Play;
* Work with what you have;
* Community;
* No authority;
* Art over competition;
* ...

I have mixed feelings about skateboarding being "accepted" into the
Olympics for 2020.

It's a chance to improve the business of skateboarding and keep
funding skaters. I'm pleased for those skaters who enjoy the
competitive aspects of the activity.

This is a good thing for skateboarding the "sport" but to many
skaters sport is not a category they recognise for their activity.
I identify with those who feel "art" to be a better category:

* Pointless;
* Style based;
* Community validated;
* Organic;

Skaters I've admired are to me as musicians are to most fans.

Tom Penny's skating makes me happy. He won competitions but
his participation disrupted them, he didn't appear to be trying.
He wasn't competing, competition footage suggests he's accidentally
winning. Like the park was in his meandering path to the shop.

I'm interested in how full-time skaters make things work.
Interviews with the Skateboard Cafe crew would be really interesting.
Can they make a living? How is their time spent? How does the
business work? Does being a community hub matter? Koran represents
both the art and the competitive aspects of being a pro-skater.

I went to the [G97 comp at Wembley Arena](https://mpora.com/videos/1UL4Lt9tx#vc7PRbCVbs25X16l.97].
It was really good, it was less a competition and more a jam. As is
the recent [Glory Challenge 2016](http://www.thrashermagazine.com/articles/videos/dime-s-glory-challenge-2016-video/).
These _jams_ are a loosely organised group of skaters egging each-
other on to do have more fun and show-off. Who "won" or ranked was 
gut feel and crowd reaction, not points, system was in effect.

This mode probably doesn't work well for TV, viewers need to 
understand what is going on with some narrative structure to hold 
it together.

Aesthetics play a huge part. Right down to sound. I've just "popped"
the shields out of my wheel bearings to get that "crispy"/"gangster"
sound. It'll likely damage the bearings and ruin their life-span 
but the "feel" comes before functionality. This runs over into my 
computer setup: ThinkPad + Linux + mechanical key-board.
