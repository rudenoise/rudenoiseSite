# Writing System 2016

Here comes some ramble, [the meat](#theMeat) comes after.

I like writing, words, their meanings, sentences and, especially,
reading. I try to write every day and, to keep things
interesting, I pay attention to the process. This includes reading
about how other writers do it and experimenting with equipment that
I find appealing. 

The process and the equipment create a context. Context alters
perception and the medium is (or affects) the message.

## Equipment

### Digital:
* Mac Book Pro (or Thinkpad x220 and earlier)
* Big monitor
* External mechanical keyboard
* (n)Vim

Typing on computers is secondary to handwriting but essential to
publishing. Touch-typing is essential.

### Analogue:
* Pilot Capless and a Kaweko Lilliput
* Rhodia dot notepads (A5, A5, A6)
* Plain A4 envelopes

Writing by hand is a context/medium that underpins the whole
process.

## <a id='theMeat'></a>The Problem

I fill up notebooks with thoughts. They go on a shelf and once a
year come back down to be read and then I am bored because
they are repetitive fragments that don't really go anywhere.

To change this, I needed an editorial process.

## The Solution

Reading about other writers' processes lead me to a few ideas
that appealed. These are the inspiration:

> [â€¦ when a] draft is finished, I put the manuscript away for a while, a week,
> a month, sometimes longer. When I take it out again, I read it as
> coldly as possible, then read it aloud to a friend or two, and
> decide what changes I want to make and whether or not I want to
> publish it.

> The pattern of the thing precedes the thing. I fill in the gaps
> of the crossword at any spot I happen to choose. These bits I
> write on index cards until the novel is done. My schedule is
> flexible, but I am rather particular about my instruments: lined
> Bristol cards and well sharpened, not too hard, pencils capped
> with erasers.

[Vladimir Nabokov's Cards](http://www.openculture.com/2014/02/the-notecards-on-which-vladimir-nabokov-wrote-lolita.html)

In his book How Shall I Tell the Dog, Miles Kington references
box-files in which he'd placed various notes and beginnings under
various subject headings. He also mentions that whenever he dipped
in and saw a promising section heading it would turn out to be empty.

And so I mixed all that together and now have this:
