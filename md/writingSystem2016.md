# Writing System 2016

I like writing stuff. I like words and their meanings, I like
sentences and love to read good ones. I like writing my own and
occasionally like reading them back (although most of the time
not). I try to write every day and to make things more interesting
I pay far too much attention to the process. This includes reading
about how successful writers do it. Getting equipment that I find
appealing and making that part of the process. 

I'll write a little more about the equipment because I like to
write and I like nice stuff and writing about nice stuff doubles
the enjoyment and I like enjoying myself. There have been two
shifts in tooling.

The first digital, I now use a Mac Book Pro as
my computer due to work reasons. I only use it as a laptop around
2% of the time as I like attaching a decent external keyboard (a WASD
) and a big monitor. Big clicky keys give a proper sense of typing.
You're definitely getting shit done when your letters make a louder
click. I think the ultimate in laptop typing is probably the
ThinkPad X220 but I can't really justify having two laptops.

Typing on computers is secondary to handwriting but essential to
publishing so to make it more fun I can definitely recommend
learning to touch-type. It's quicker and makes you feel like a T.V.
computerist, which is very important. It's really easy to learn, it
only too 3 weeks and a free online tool (there are loads, try a few
if you're considering it).

The absolute most important thing to do when typing on a computer
is to use a terminal based editor with a black background. I use
Vim and can't recommend it highly enough. Again this is as much
about feel as creativity. If it feels good it is good.

Having said all that about computer-writing I do the majority on
paper. Up until September last year I used hand sharpened Tombow
Mono 100 2B pencils with plain Moleskin Cahier notebooks. Then I
read about fountain pens being designed to be the most smooth
action, friction free writing implements and thought I'd give that
a go. So I use a Pilot Capless and a Kaweko Lilliput (for my
pocket) with Rhodia dot notepads. And these have to be easy tear
out (perforated) ones because I'm using the following system to
write:

## The Problem

I fill up notebooks with thoughts. They go on a shelf and once a
year I pull them down to read them and get really bored because
they are repetitive fragments that don't really go anywhere.

There needs to be some editorial process and refinement.

## The Solution

Reading about other writers' processes lead me to pick a few ideas
that I think would work for me. These are the inspiration:

> [â€¦ when a] draft is finished, I put the manuscript away for a while, a week,
> a month, sometimes longer. When I take it out again, I read it as
> coldly as possible, then read it aloud to a friend or two, and
> decide what changes I want to make and whether or not I want to
> publish it.

> The pattern of the thing precedes the thing. I fill in the gaps
> of the crossword at any spot I happen to choose. These bits I
> write on index cards until the novel is done. My schedule is
> flexible, but I am rather particular about my instruments: lined
> Bristol cards and well sharpened, not too hard, pencils capped
> with erasers.

In his book How Shall I Tell the Dog, Miles Kington references
box-files in which he'd placed various notes and beginnings under
various subject headings. He also mentions that whenever he dipped
in and saw a promising section heading it would turn out to be empty.

And so I mixed all that together and now have this:
