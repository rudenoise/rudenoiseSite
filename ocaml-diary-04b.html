<p>Previously, while learning languages, I've made the same small, CLI application. A program that walks through the contents of a directory, stores the paths of any files contained within, then does the same for any sub-directories, recursively. These paths can then be printed to the console directly, or filtered then printed. So far I've done this task using NodeJS<sub>[<em><a href="#ref1">1</a></em>]</sub>, Go<sub>[<em><a href="#ref2">2</a></em>]</sub> and Gambit Scheme<sub>[<em><a href="#ref3">3</a></em>]</sub>. I usually call it <em>inPath</em>.</p>
<p>The aim is to test my ability to build something small, self contained and useful, from scratch. Doing so ensures that I understand the tools used to build and debug an app, and where to find supporting information.</p>
<h2 id="the-development-experience">The Development Experience</h2>
<p>The OCaml development cycle went something like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Edit inPath.ml in vim.</li>
<li>Save and see if <em>Merlin</em><sub>[<em><a href="#ref4">4</a></em>]</sub> has picked up any problems.</li>
<li>Run <em>MerlinErrorCheck</em> correct as necessary.</li>
<li>Run <em>corebuild inPath.byte</em> for fast compilation to byte-code, then test.</li>
<li>Every few successful builds compile a native executable with <em>corebuild inPath.native</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Getting the environment set-up involves a few steps but afterwards the cycle was smooth and efficient. It may only be a tiny project but the supporting tools still impressed. The compilers are not as simple as those provided by Go (there are a lot of ways to compile an OCaml program) but are still manageable for a novice.</p>
<p>The program used various modules from <em>Core.Std</em><sub>[<em><a href="#ref5">5</a></em>]</sub>, an equivalent to a standard-library (OCaml keeps itself small allowing the user to extend/include functionality, as required). Building CLI apps is well supported via the <em>Command</em><sub>[<em><a href="#ref6">6</a></em>]</sub> module. Help text, input parsing and flags have useful APIs, getting the basics working was equivalent the effort spent in other ecosystems.</p>
<p>Switching between &quot;pure functional&quot; (for internal data structures and recursion) and imperative (communicating with the environment outside) APIs was useful. Having distinct types and modules for each helps to define the boundaries.</p>
<p>The general impression I've formed is that OCaml has a reasonably high barrier to entry. There are many ways to use the tools and language and this can feel daunting. Conversely, the many combinations/configurations available make it possible to express very clear programs that are tailored and specific to their problem-space. The type system and language design also make solutions less ambiguous. I'm less likely to mistake one implementation for another and should I, the compiler should know about it.</p>
<p>Iterating the design and implementation of OCaml programs differs from the other ecosystems. Getting a basic/prototype implementation was quick. Refactoring could then take a number of paths depending on how I wished to extend the functionality. Moving data processing to purely functional data-structures and APIs, for example. Or bundling areas of the code into modules, using their own types and interfaces, to aid separation of concerns, documentation of intent, and reuse. Various constructs for building flows and passing data between functions could be chosen. I didn't get as far as using the native profiling tools or compiler configurations. I expect they would add yet more food for thought.</p>
<p>This could be seen as unnecessary complexity, especially when compared with Go's approach. But getting something basic working was fast enough, after which point there were many options available for improvement. While the implementation was not uniform it is descriptive. It's a different approach and one I enjoyed.</p>
<h2 id="the-results">The Results</h2>
<p>A few hours mucking about and I had the basics working. Some OCaml knowledge had seeped in and remained long enough to build working software. Then I had a look at the results and compared them to other implementations.</p>

<p>I ran the following test for each binary and took a rough average (excluding any outliers caused by OS caching).</p>
<pre class="sh"><code>time inPathOCaml ~/Dropbox/ &gt; /tmp/out.txt </code></pre>

<p>These tests are not that useful for anything serious but that didn't stop me from drawing the following, probably inaccurate, conclusions:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>The <em>core</em> lib must be pretty big and including it leads to the large binary.</li>
<li>The execution time isn't adversely affected by the unused functionality.</li>
<li>I could rewrite this code to exclude <em>core</em>.</li>
<li>Managing the compilers could have lead to a more tailored result.</li>
</ol>
<p>The code is up for criticism on GitHub <sub>[<em><a href="#ref7">7</a></em>]</sub>.</p>
