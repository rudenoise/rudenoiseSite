        <h1 id="about-this-web-log">About this Web-Log</h1>
        <p>I've done blogs before. One was about programming and included posts about things like <a href="https://medium.com/@rudenoise/code-life-cycle-every-line-is-technical-debt-f90db48786d8">technical debt in code</a>. Another was about a man who travels through time to hear <a href="http://poochat.blogspot.co.uk/">toilet related stories</a> from well-known faces.</p>
        <p>Then I stopped. For the last few years I've been filling up notebooks, chatting on to people and making things out of code. Fine but it didn't really lead anywhere.</p>
        <p>Now I want to create the possibility that the stuff I think about might overlap with the stuff other people think about. Then those people have a small chance of discovering this overlap and then they might respond. In which case I might learn something, make a friend or even be called a twat. Which doesn't happen often enough.</p>
        <p>So this will be a web-log of my thoughts, a broad remit.</p>
