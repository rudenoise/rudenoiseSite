<p>Here comes some ramble, <a href="#theMeat">the meat</a> comes after.</p>
<p>I like writing, words, their meanings, sentences and, especially, reading. I try to write every day and, to keep things interesting, I pay attention to the process. This includes reading about how other writers do it. Incorporating equipment that I find appealing and making that part of the process.</p>
<p>The process and the equipment create a context. Context alters perception. The medium is the message, or at least affects it.</p>
<h2 id="equipment">Equipment</h2>
<h3 id="digital">Digital:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Mac Book Pro (or Thinkpad x220 and earlier)</li>
<li>Big monitor</li>
<li>External mechanical keyboard</li>
<li>Vim</li>
</ul>
<p>Typing on computers is secondary to handwriting but essential to publishing. Learn to touch-type. It's quicker and feels good. It can be learned in three weeks as part of usual computer use.</p>
<h3 id="analogue">Analogue:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Pilot Capless and a Kaweko Lilliput</li>
<li>Rhodia dot notepads (A5, A5, A6)</li>
<li>Plain A4 envelopes</li>
</ul>
<p>Writing by hand is another context/medium and influences the process.</p>
<h2 id="the-problem"><a id='theMeat'></a>The Problem</h2>
<p>I fill up notebooks with thoughts. They go on a shelf and once a year come back down to be read and then I am bored because they are repetitive fragments that don't really go anywhere.</p>
<p>There needs to be some editorial process and refinement.</p>
<h2 id="the-solution">The Solution</h2>
<p>Reading about other writers' processes lead me to pick a few ideas that I think would work for me. These are the inspiration:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[â€¦ when a] draft is finished, I put the manuscript away for a while, a week, a month, sometimes longer. When I take it out again, I read it as coldly as possible, then read it aloud to a friend or two, and decide what changes I want to make and whether or not I want to publish it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The pattern of the thing precedes the thing. I fill in the gaps of the crossword at any spot I happen to choose. These bits I write on index cards until the novel is done. My schedule is flexible, but I am rather particular about my instruments: lined Bristol cards and well sharpened, not too hard, pencils capped with erasers.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In his book How Shall I Tell the Dog, Miles Kington references box-files in which he'd placed various notes and beginnings under various subject headings. He also mentions that whenever he dipped in and saw a promising section heading it would turn out to be empty.</p>
<p>And so I mixed all that together and now have this:</p>

<ul>
<li>Use a system</li>
<li>Keep it simple</li>
<li>Change it often</li>
<li>Make it appealing</li>
</ul>
